* sh-eldoc

 This library provides additional Eldoc functions for shell scripting in Emacs. It is useful for script writers who need quick reminders about syntax and usage of shell commands and constructs.

** Installation

Emacs >= 26.1 is required.

*** Manual

Download the source code and put it wherever you like, e.g. into =~/.emacs.d/sh-eldoc/=

#+begin_src shell :eval no
git clone https://github.com/KarimAziev/sh-eldoc.git ~/.emacs.d/sh-eldoc/
#+end_src

Add the downloaded directory to the load path:

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/sh-eldoc/")
(require 'sh-eldoc)
(add-hook 'sh-mode-hook 'sh-eldoc-setup)

#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(use-package sh-eldoc
  :straight (sh-eldoc
             :repo "KarimAziev/sh-eldoc"
             :type git
             :host github)
  :hook ((sh-base-mode . sh-eldoc-setup)))
#+end_src
